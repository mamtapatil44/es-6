// 1. 1. What will be the output of the following code, and why?
// ```javascript
// for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
//   setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
// }
// ```
// Hint: Understand how `let` maintains block scope 
// compared to `var`.


// ans : output whould be  :0,1,2 : because let where has block scope , so for every ietration it will create new instance wiith new reference for variable, so everytime you will get new value
//  and if var this there it will create glboal variable with same refernace each time,so we get value same that is length , each time
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log("i=",i), 1000);
}



// 2. 2. Can you reassign a `const` variable if it holds an object? Explain with 
// an example.
// Hint: Focus on the immutability of the reference, not 
// the object's properties.

// ans:
// Yes, you can modify the properties of an object assigned to a const variable, 
// but you cannot reassign the const variable itself to a new object. 
// The key thing to understand here is that const only ensures that the reference to the object is immutable, 
// not the objectâ€™s internal properties.
// ex.

const myObj = {
    name: "mamta",
    gender:"female"

}
// we can modify the properties of object
myObj.name ="sp";
console.log("myObj ",myObj)
// myObj = {
//     name: "Krtitika",
//     gender:"female"

// }

// console.log("myObj ",myObj)
// here we are trying to reassign object to const variable so it will trow type error


// 3. What are the benefits of using `let` and `const` over `var` in ES6? 
// Provide real-world examples.
// Hint: Think about block scoping and hoisting 
// differences

// ans:
// 1 . let and const have block scope , scope with {} ,so if we trying to access that variable outside of that scope ,it wull give refenece tye error
//  var variable have function or global scope

// var and let can declare and reassign the value for it ,but for const it is not possible it will throw tyep error

// redeclare only var variable can be redclare but it will make confusion in the code,so its not reliable

// hoisting : var avraiable is hoisted we can access the var araiable value before declaring it with undefined
// let are not hoisted ,they have temporal dead zone :means time perios for delaction to intializing ,if we access this between taht zone,it will give refernce type error

// benefits of let and const
// Block Scoping: Avoids issues of variables leaking into unintended scopes.
// Hoisting with Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ): Reduces the chance of using variables before they are initialized.
// Immutability with const: Protects variables from accidental reassignment, while still allowing modification of object properties.
// Prevention of Redeclarations: Reduces errors due to accidentally redeclaring variables in the same scope.
// Cleaner Code: Encourages more predictable and readable code



// 4. 4. Explain why the following code throws an error:
// ```javascript
// const a;
// a = 10;
// ```
// Hint: Consider how `const` must be initialized at 
// declaration.

// ans:
// When you declare a variable with const, JavaScript expects that variable to have a value immediately. 
// This is different from let or var, which allow you to declare a variable and initialize it later.
// The statement const a; is incomplete because a is declared without a value.
// JavaScript expects an initializer (i.e., a value) to be assigned at the point of declaration.
// This is why the code throws the error: "Missing initializer in const declaration."
